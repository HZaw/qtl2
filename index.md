tagline: QTL analysis for high-dimensional data and complex crosses

R/qtl2 (aka qtl2) is a reimplementation of the QTL analysis software
[R/qtl](http://www.rqtl.org), to better handle high-dimensional data
and complex cross designs.

The package is early in development.

We're testing out different methods for linear regression; there are
some benchmarks [here](assets/vignettes/linreg_benchmarks.html).

The internal data structure for R/qtl2 is different from that of
[R/qtl](http://www.rqtl.org), and the input data file format has also
changed. Sample data files are available [here](pages/sampledata.html).
