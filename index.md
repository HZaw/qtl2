tagline: QTL analysis for high-dimensional data and complex crosses

R/qtl2 (aka qtl2) is an effort to reimplement the QTL analysis software
[R/qtl](http://www.rqtl.org), to better handle high-dimensional data
and complex cross designs.

There's not much implemented yet; I'm testing out different methods
for linear regression; there are some benchmarks
[here](assets/vignettes/linreg_benchmarks.html).
